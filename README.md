## Overview
This Arduino project implements a mini memory game where players repeat a sequence of LEDs and tones generated by a buzzer. It was originally developed for educational purposes as part of a volunteer project. The game helps users enhance their memory skills through interactive gameplay.

## Hardware Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following hardware components:
- Arduino board
- Breadboard
- 4 LEDs
- 4 push buttons
- 1 buzzer
- 8 resistors (minimum 220 ohms): 4 for the push buttons and 4 for the LEDs.

### Pin Configuration

The game utilizes specific pins on the Arduino board for various components:

- LEDs are connected to pins 2, 3, 4, and 5.
- Buttons are connected to pins 6, 7, 8, and 9.
- The buzzer is connected to pin 10.

Ensure these connections match the definitions in the code (`ledPins`, `buttonPins`, and `buzzerPin`) to ensure proper functionality of the game.

## Installation
1. Connect the hardware components as described in the [Hardware Requirements](#hardware-requirements) section.
2. Upload the provided code (`memory_game.ino`) to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE or any compatible IDE.

## Usage
1. Upon starting, the game will display a sequence of LED flashes and corresponding tones from the buzzer.
2. After the sequence, the player must repeat the pattern by pressing the corresponding buttons.
3. The game checks if the player's sequence matches the original pattern.
4. If correct, the game adds a new step to the pattern and continues.
5. If incorrect, the game signals a loss with flashing LEDs and a buzzer sound, then restarts.
